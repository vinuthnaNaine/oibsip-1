Iris Flower Classification

This project is a machine learning classification task to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. It uses the Iris dataset and implements a Random Forest classifier to achieve this goal.

Dataset

The dataset used is the Iris Dataset, which contains the following features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Species (Target variable)

Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Project Structure

Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation.
Iris.csv: The dataset used for training and testing.

Steps in the Notebook

Import Libraries: Load necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
Load Dataset: Read the dataset and explore its structure.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical data if necessary.
Data Visualization: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to analyze feature distributions and correlations.
Model Training: Implement a Random Forest classifier using Scikit-Learn.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Running the Notebook

To execute the notebook:

Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb and run the cells step by step.
Results

The model predicts the species of iris flowers with a high level of accuracy. Results are evaluated using various classification metrics.
